 Woozee Movies Built Using React.JS & Firebase & Redux
</h1>

<p><font size="3">
  Woozeee website built using <strong><em>React.JS</em></strong> as a Front-end & <strong><em>Firebase</em></strong> as Authenticate  & <strong><em>Redux</em></strong> as state management.  it's a similar version of Netflix with my own design touch, showing my abilities in React.JS to build something advanced   like Netflix. It contains the home page, sign-in page, sign-up page, browse page, and movie player.
